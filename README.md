### What is an UNA?

An unincorporated nonprofit association (UNA) is the default legal category for groups of individuals who come together to engage in nonprofit activities. Unlike more formal legal entities, such as nonprofit corporations, UNAs traditionally lack a separate legal identity distinct from their individual members. This characteristic has significant implications, particularly from a legal standpoint, as it means that the liabilities, obligations, and responsibilities of the UNA are typically shared among its individual members.

This shared liability aspect has often been a source of concern and complexity in legal matters involving UNAs. To illustrate the potential risks, let's consider a hypothetical scenario: Suppose you joined an amateur baseball team that operates as an UNA. During a game, a baseball is hit into the stands, causing severe injuries to a spectator. In this situation, if the team is an UNA and no other legal entity is in place, you, as a member, could be held personally liable for the damages suffered by the injured person.

This concept of personal liability stems from the fact that an UNA lacks a distinct legal identity. As a result, the law may attribute the actions and consequences of the UNA to each individual member personally. This means that if the UNA faces legal claims or obligations, the members could be individually responsible for any resulting liabilities, legal fees, or damages.

### Why would any sane person want to be part of an UNA?

They typically don't. However, there are instances where individuals may find themselves inadvertently part of a UNA, which can lead to unexpected legal complexities and potential liabilities. 

Take, for example, the case of the Ooki DAO. In this specific situation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sought to hold the Ooki DAO accountable for alleged violations of the Commodities Exchange Act. Despite heroic arguments from LeXpunK and a16z, who acted as amici (friends of the court), the judge ruled that the CFTC had "sufficiently alleged, for the purposes of their service motion, that Ooki DAO is an unincorporated association" under California law.

The ruling shed light on an important aspect of DAO, namely, that individuals who own a DAO's tokens can potentially be considered part of an UNA, *even if they're just passive token holders*. The court noted that "based on the complaint it seems that individuals who own but do not vote their token still comprise the DAO because the purpose of holding a token is being able to vote on the DAO's governance."

This raises concerns, particularly in worst-case scenarios, where the absence of a clear legal separation between the DAO UNA and its individual members could create a situation where personal liability extends to all token holders. This is particularly alarming considering the decentralized nature of many DAOs, which lack a centralized governance structure or legal entity that could defend itself in court.

### What can be done?

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the limitations faced by unincorporated nonprofit associations (UNAs), leading several states and Washington, DC to enact legislation based on the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (UUNAA). The UUNAA serves as a model framework that aims to enhance the legal status and protections afforded to UNAs.

States such as South Carolina, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Iowa, Nevada, and Washington, DC have adopted legislation inspired by the UUNAA. These jurisdictions acknowledge the importance of providing UNAs with a distinct legal identity, similar to that of incorporated nonprofit organizations. This recognition brings forth numerous advantages and opportunities for UNAs.

A key benefit offered to UNAs under UUNAA-inspired legislation is the ability to obtain a separate entity status independent of their individual members. This legal recognition empowers the UNA to enter into contracts, own property, and assume responsibility for its own obligations and liabilities. Consequently, individual members of the UNA generally enjoy limited liability, shielding their personal assets from the organization's debts and legal claims.

Moreover, with the conferred entity status, UNAs gain the capacity to own and transfer property. This grants them the ability to acquire various assets, such as real estate, vehicles, or intellectual property, in the name of the organization. Additionally, it allows UNAs to enter into agreements, leases, and contracts on behalf of the association, facilitating their operational activities and ensuring long-term sustainability.

The concept of UNAs for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) has been proposed and developed by Aaron Wright, a notable law professor and cypherpunk advocate, along with contributions from a16z in a series of research papers. Building upon these ideas, the objective of this repository is to establish a legal framework that enables DAOs to declare themselves as UNAs within jurisdictions that have enacted UUNAA-inspired legislation.

The goal is to provide DAOs with the ability to assert that they do not consider themselves UNAs, but if they are categorized as such, they can choose a specific jurisdiction, such as Nevada, which offers comprehensive liability protections for their members. Furthermore, the repository aims to grant governance powers to token holders and/or multisig holders, allowing them to appoint a manager, and hire an attorney who could represent the DAO UNA in court.
